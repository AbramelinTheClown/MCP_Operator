# The orpheus-speech library includes its own dependencies like torch and vllm.
orpheus-speech

# You might need to explicitly add torch if orpheus-speech doesn't pull a compatible version
# or if you need a specific version for other reasons.
# torch # Add if needed, specify version if conflicts arise (e.g., torch==2.2.0)

# As per Orpheus docs, pinning vllm might be necessary due to bugs:
# vllm==0.7.3 # Uncomment if you encounter issues with the latest vllm from orpheus-speech

# Add any other core dependencies your mcp_operator project needs
# (e.g., logging libraries, configuration parsing libraries, etc.)
